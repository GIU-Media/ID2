You can use something like:  https://www.bibme.org/bibliographies/263797904?new=true)

### USER RESEARCH
2 in-depth qualitative interviews with: One member of your target audience and one person in the field (eg: if your concept is a digital platform for performance artists, interview a performance artist to get their input and ideas on the concept to enrich your project)
Develop 1 persona per interview (persona examples on intranet in week 02 folder or use guides from last semester)

### CONCEPT DEVELOPMENT

# Session 3
Exploring a Case Study


Investigating how design and functional patterns and visual consistency work with examples.
* Functional patterns are behaviours you enable the user to do
* Functional patterns are page types
* Functional patterns are UI-elements
  
[slideset session 3](ID2-WS-24-03_case_study.pdf) 

## workshop / homework task
Each member of group develops one persona and one user journey. 

* Persona: 
Develop 3 diverse personas per group (expert user, inexperienced user, extreme user) 

Use interviews and knowledge of people in your target groups. Combine insights discovered into your persona.   
* User journey: 
Develop a detailed user journey for your persona for your concept. 

Remember do not include your website in your user journey, the user journey is what similar activity your users did before your website existed to find out what kind of happy/pain moments and questions your website can improve and then find the function opportunities for your site.

Continue your research, find out more about your topic, interview your target,  do field research on the ground.  Examples can be found on the CMS to recap from last semester.
