Course Description and Aims:
Lecture: 
The purpose of this course is to extend the overview of how people interact with computer applications within a certain context. Specifically, in this course the student will learn how to develop service driven interaction design concepts for digital platforms. The course provides the students with service design and interaction design research methods in order to identify and to describe the users problems based on context, behavior and motivation.
Tutorial: The aim of the course is to introduce practical knowledge about research and project planning methods, which focus on user behavior within the context of digital platforms as well as user interface characteristics. Students will develop visual design skills using design principles for mobile and web apps and their different screen resolutions; learning how to improve the layout, navigational usability and legibility of certain digital platforms by focusing on textual hierarchy, consistency, and formatting.

# Learning Outcomes:
By the end of the course, students will be able to:
* Knowledge and Understanding
* Recall and define a user journey
* Discuss and describe a mental model
* Summarize and explain sensors and how to use them § Specify personas
* Recall resolution and dimension for digital devices
* Specify the usage and effects of pictograms, color and type for mobile and web app and its experience 
* Recall different navigation principles for mobile and web app usage 

## b. Intellectual Skills
* Interpret qualitative research methods to detect user problems, motivations and needs 
* Discover user engagement strategies
* Detect innovative links between “Form” and “Content”
* Compare different graphical styles for user interfaces
* Distinguish between usage, form and style for user interfaces 

## c. Professional and Practical Skills
